# Twines and Straps SA E-Commerce Platform

This repository contains the source code for the Twines and Straps SA e-commerce platform, a combined B2C/B2B solution built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Project Overview

The platform will feature direct online sales, a streamlined request-for-quote (RFQ) flow for B2B buyers, and a powerful admin portal for non-technical staff to manage products and content.
